In life we sometimes meet a particular kind of excellent person; someone who stands out, who we don't forget easily and who we always have time for. These people show us the human greatness in the world with almost everything they do.

You could call such a person a 'gentleman', 'kind hearted' or 'benevolant', but we find these words miss the mark. We call these people **Fuckin' Champs**, and we aspire to being one.

Presented here are the attributes we try to foster in ourselves, our _manifesto of a fuckin' champ_.
